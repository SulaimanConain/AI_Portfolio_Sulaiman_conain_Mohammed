Data Engineer: Azure Data Engineering project for Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM):
Designed and implemented end-to-end Azure Data Engineering pipelines using Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and Azure SQL DB to ingest, process, and transform complex healthcare datasets, including EMR, claims, NPI, ICD, and CPT data, enabling real-time and batch processing in a Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers).
Developed scalable data pipelines for incremental and full data loads using the audit logging mechanism and metadata-driven configuration, improving data ingestion efficiency and reliability across multiple hospital systems and insurance providers.
Engineered robust Delta Lake data models incorporating Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2 (SCD2) and Common Data Model (CDM) standards to maintain historical accuracy and data lineage, facilitating accurate KPIs and financial reporting on Accounts Receivable and Payable in healthcare revenue cycle management.
Automated data quality validation and quarantine workflows within the Silver layer to ensure high-quality analytical data for downstream data scientists and business users, reducing data discrepancies and enhancing trust in healthcare financial reports.
Improved data security and operational efficiency by integrating Azure Key Vault for secure credential management and implemented Unity Catalog to streamline Azure Databricks data governance and access control.
Optimized Azure Data Factory pipelines from sequential to parallel execution, significantly reducing data processing time and latency for healthcare financial datasets across multiple hospitals and insurance claim systems.
Enhanced pipeline robustness by implementing retry mechanisms, active/inactive flags, and consistent naming conventions for datasets and storage structures across Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, enabling maintainable and scalable data architecture.
Delivered comprehensive fact and dimension tables in the Gold layer to empower business reporting teams with actionable insights into revenue cycle KPIs such as Days in AR, AR > 90 days, and payment collection efficiency, directly supporting hospital financial health monitoring and cash flow optimization.
