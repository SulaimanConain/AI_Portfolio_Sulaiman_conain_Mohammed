WORK EXPERIENCE:
Advance AI Lab – Toronto, ON
Software Developer | Sep 2023 - Present
- Designed and developed a web-based multilingual translation platform to facilitate effective communication between healthcare providers and patients across 20+ languages.
- Built backend services using FastAPI with asynchronous support to handle real-time translation requests at scale.
- Integrated DeepSeek AI API for high-accuracy, real-time translations, implementing caching and fallback logic to ensure resilience and performance.
- Implemented secure user authentication and role-based access control using OAuth2, JWT, and password hashing via passlib.
- Designed normalized SQLite database schemas and optimized query performance to improve translation data handling.
- Developed RESTful APIs for text translation, multilingual chat, batch processing, and medical summary generation.
- Led implementation of email verification and password reset features using FastAPI’s BackgroundTasks and secure token generation.
- Created a responsive, user-friendly frontend using Jinja2, Bootstrap, and vanilla JavaScript, ensuring compatibility across devices and screen sizes.
- Focused on accessibility, data privacy, and scalability, aligning the project with real-world healthcare communication needs.
- Explored integration patterns with external AI services and laid the groundwork for potential deployment to cloud-based environments.

IO Solutions inc – Montreal, QC
Python Software Developer | Aug 2022 – Oct 2023
- Designed and deployed a scalable REST API backend using Django REST Framework, powering a job-matching platform for multilingual users across Canada.
- Built a real-time applicant tracking dashboard with Flask, integrating Socket.IO for live updates and recruiter collaboration.
- Implemented secure user authentication and role-based permissions using JWT tokens and Django’s built-in auth system.
- Created reusable components and custom middleware to handle user onboarding, form validation, and error handling efficiently.
- Automated resume parsing and keyword extraction using Python NLP libraries (spaCy, NLTK) and stored structured data in PostgreSQL.
- Integrated Celery and Redis to offload long-running tasks (e.g., PDF parsing, email dispatch) to background workers, improving response times by 60%.
- Deployed the full stack on Heroku and AWS EC2, using Nginx and Gunicorn for production-grade performance.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, automating tests, code linting, and deployment across staging and production.
- Ensured GDPR-compliant data handling and included dynamic language localization for both recruiters and job seekers.
